    "interestsText": "In my free time, I am active in the Student Sailing Club of Warsaw University of Technology (SKÅ»). I am licensed to operate inland and maritime yachts. My goal is to lead an independent sea voyage. My interests also include rollerblading and ice skating. From 2017 to 2019, I was a member of the Night Skating Team, which organizes night rollerblading rides through the streets of Warsaw. In the evenings, I also work on my own web application and solve various coding challenges like Advent of Code and tasks on the LeetCode platform. In summary, I enjoy learning new patterns, gaining knowledge, and sharing it with others."
